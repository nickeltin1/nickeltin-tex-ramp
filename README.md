# nickeltin-tex-ramp
Just some experiments with textures generated in edtior.
Allows to create ramp textures from custom file format .texramp, this is combinations of curves for each channel or gradeint.
All this data in import time used to create texture with discrete resolution that can be used anywhere (mainly was created for shaders, but ramps also works great for UI tints)
